# Financial Volatility Forecasting

Forecasting financial market volatility using classical econometric
time-series models, with a focus on capturing volatility clustering
and mean-reversion behavior.

## Approach
- Used a GARCH model for conditional variance estimation
- Applied rolling-window estimation to adapt to regime changes
- Evaluated forecasts against realized variance metrics on simulated
  daily and intraday (5-minute) data
